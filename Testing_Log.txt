Testing Log:

Hope Page:
    1. Need to fix text for place holder articles. 


1. Profile app, wrong message tpye showing in message window.
    Updated message type to info, so the that checkout button is not included.

3. Order confirmation em-mail, cost, shipping etc were showing as $, updated the message template to € as per site set-up.

4. Display om Home page. Buttons not showing on mobile, hidden under following card and last button 

5. Login / Logout success message displaying Cart Button.
    Added if statement to toast success to not display the button for certain circumstances.

6. Posted review, drop down for recommended product on mobile too small.
    Move to new line for small screens.

7. Customer reviews. Updated producst view to include an order option to display the most recent review first

8. Customer review, template was using full date / time from the DB. Updated Django template date output to onlu display day/monthyear.
    Used month Name, for the avodiance of doubt in countries using other formats

9. Anonymous Ordering : Issue when customer is not logged in, order was placed and e-mail received confirming order. but site failed on order successful page.
    There was an issue with checkout view, there was a missing if request.user.is_authenticated missing from checkout_success function so system was trying to save 
    info to profile that did not exist. 
    Added the if statement. 

10. checkout template references $ in the template instead of €
    Updated to € symbol

11. Components and Sensors options in dropdown points to USB Dongles.
    Updated href for Components and sensors

12. Console error > Uncaught IntegrationError: Please call Stripe() with your publishable key. You used an empty string.
            @ static/checkout/js/stripe_elements.js:3
    
    fix :ixed issue where console was throwing up 'Uncaught IntegrationError: Please call Stripe() with your publishable key.', 
    there was a missing return in the function StripeWH_Handler. added the additional return."

13. Plus (+) / Minus (-) buttons not being disabled on Cart. Two issues found here:
    a. On a larger screen the buttons are in a table, I can not get the jQuery to target the ID of the button within the table.
        Once its outside the table it will target the ID. 
    b. Products with addtional options, can have multiple line items in the cart with the same product ID, creating duplicate IDs on the same page. 

    Fixes:
    a. As the buttons are not critical on larger screens I have opted to remove the buttons. Otherwise I would have to rewrite the page without a table.
        This is an issue, I will revisit but the current deadline does not provide time. 
    b. On mobile, the bottons are mnore critical due to the small size of the intergrated buttons in the input field.
        To fix the issues of duplicate IDs, I have added the ram & power template tags to the ID ensuring that the ID is unique in all situations.
